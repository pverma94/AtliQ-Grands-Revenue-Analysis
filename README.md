# AtliQ Grands Revenue Insight

## Project Overview
AtliQ Grands, a luxury five-star hotel chain in India, has been experiencing a decline in market share and revenue due to strategic competition and ineffective decision-making. To address this challenge, the managing director has decided to leverage **Business and Data Intelligence** to make informed revenue-based decisions. Since AtliQ Grands lacks an in-house data analytics team, a third-party service provider has been hired to analyze historical data and provide actionable insights.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to examine the sample dataset and create an interactive dashboard that presents key revenue-related metrics. The final output is intended to assist the **Revenue Management Team** in making data-driven decisions to improve market position and financial performance.

## Tasks
1. **Create Metrics**: Develop the required KPIs based on the provided metric list.
2. **Design Dashboard**: Develop an interactive dashboard as per the stakeholder-provided mock-up.
3. **Generate Insights**: Identify additional relevant insights that are not explicitly covered in the metric list or dashboard.
